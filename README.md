# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a fully functional feedforward neural network **from scratch** using only NumPy and Pandas — no high-level ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It is designed to demystify the internal workings of neural networks by manually coding forward propagation, backpropagation, weight updates, and activation functions.

The model is trained and tested on the classic **IRIS** and **MNIST** datasets, showcasing its ability to perform both multi-class classification and image recognition tasks.
